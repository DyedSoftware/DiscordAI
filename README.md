**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/djs) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the discord.js codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `yarn --immutable` ([install](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
3. Run `yarn build` to build local packages
4. Code your heart out!
5. Run `yarn test` to run ESLint and ensure any JSDoc changes are valid
6. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/main/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
